For a small or mid-sized Indian business that just needs customer engagement automation, it is too big, too slow and too costly to set up. SwanDigitals gives you WhatsApp, web chat and +91 calling in one inbox, live in days. Where Pega may fit better: very large enterprises automating complex multi-department core processes."
