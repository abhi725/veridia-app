            aboutCompetitor="MSG91 is a traditional telecom provider that built its reputation on bulk SMS. Their 'Hello' inbox attempts to bundle legacy communication channels, but it remains tied to older messaging models."
            competitorStrengths="Excellent reliability for sending millions of transactional OTP SMS messages and deep integration with Indian carrier systems."
            realityCheck="MSG91 is built on telecom infrastructure, not artificial intelligence. While 'Hello' offers a basic inbox, it lacks deep Generative AI integration, vector databases, and real voice AI. If you want automated systems that actually resolve customer issues using company knowledge, their legacy system will hold you back."
