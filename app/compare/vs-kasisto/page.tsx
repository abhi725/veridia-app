            competitorStrengths="Strong US banking integrations and finance-specific models built for large American institutions."
            realityCheck="Kasisto is built for big US banks with big budgets and long procurement cycles, which does not fit a small or mid-sized Indian business. SwanDigitals gives you WhatsApp, web chat and +91 calling in one inbox, in 10 Indian languages, live in days on flat rupee pricing. Where Kasisto may fit better: very large banks needing deep, custom core-banking AI."
