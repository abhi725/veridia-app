            realityCheck="Crisp is great for manual typing, but its AI is basic and it stores data on servers outside India. For an Indian SME that wants to automate WhatsApp and phone support, that means limited automation and offshore data. SwanDigitals adds self-training AI, native +91 voice and data hosted in India. Where Crisp may fit better: tiny teams that just want a light, cheap inbox for manual chat."
