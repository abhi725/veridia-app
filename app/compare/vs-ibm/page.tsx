            realityCheck="Deploying IBM Watson usually means hiring specialist consultants and months of development, which is far too heavy and expensive for a small or mid-sized Indian business. SwanDigitals is a fully managed cloud platform that goes live in days: WhatsApp, web chat and +91 calling in one inbox, on flat rupee pricing. Where IBM may fit better: very large multinationals with dedicated dev teams and complex core systems."
