- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Metadata), Redis (Session Store), ElasticSearch (Knowledge Base).

## Key Features Deep Dive

### 1. Visual Flow Builder
Users can build complex conversation flows visually but can also "break out" into code for custom logic.

### 2. Knowledge Graph
Veridia ingests documents (PDF, Docx, HTML) to build a semantic knowledge graph, allowing the AI to answer unstructured questions accurately.

### 3. Agent Assist
For queries that require human intervention, Veridia provides "Agent Assist" - a sidebar for support agents that suggests answers in real-time.
